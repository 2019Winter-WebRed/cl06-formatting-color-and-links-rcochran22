        <main><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labs are one of the most adorable dogs in the world. Not only are they adorable they can be very lazy when they want to be but they can also be extremly energetic on most days. I have a chocolate lab,Toby, he is the best dog ever. </p>
            
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the cutest thing. He lays at the bottom of my bed and watches tv with me almost all the time. He is very protective of me and my sisters. Whenever someone is driving, biking, walking or even comes close to our gate he barks like crazy!</p>
